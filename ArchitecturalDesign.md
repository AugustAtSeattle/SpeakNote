### Architectural Design for MVP
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: Ideal for separating UI, business logic, and data modeling, simplifying testing and maintenance.
- **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data access logic, beneficial for future complex data operations or additional data sources.
- **Observer Pattern**: To update the UI in real-time as new notes are created or existing ones are modified.
