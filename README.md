## Project Overview
SpeakNote leverages the power of Whisper and GPT to transform note-taking into a hands-free, voice-activated experience on iOS platforms. Users can effortlessly dictate tasks, manage lists, and set remindersâ€”all through intuitive voice commands.

The application utilizes Whisper for superior voice recognition, ensuring accurate transcription of spoken words into text, while GPT's advanced AI capabilities enable smart organization and retrieval of notes. This powerful combination makes SpeakNote an essential tool for efficient and effective task management in a fast-paced world.

### Core Features for MVP
- **Voice-Activated Note-Taking**: Users can speak to the app, and it transcribes their speech into text notes.
- **Local Storage of Notes**: Notes are stored securely in the device's local storage.
- **Basic Query Functionality**: Users can retrieve and view their notes based on simple queries.

### Architectural Design for MVP
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: Ideal for separating UI, business logic, and data modeling, simplifying testing and maintenance.
- **Repository Pattern**: For abstracting data access logic, beneficial for future complex data operations or additional data sources.
- **Observer Pattern**: To update the UI in real-time as new notes are created or existing ones are modified.

### Future Expansion Considerations
- **Siri Integration and Dual Language Support**: Planned for future versions as enhancements. The architecture is designed to be flexible to integrate these features without a major overhaul.
- **Modular Design**: Components like voice recognition and language processing are kept modular for easy upgrades or replacements.
- **Cloud Storage**: Future versions may support cloud storage for notes, enabling users to access their notes across devices.
